# Bluetooth-Based-Smart-Lock-System

## Objective:
- The Bluetooth-based Smart Locking System is a project developed using LPC2148 microcontroller, an LCD display, HC-05 Bluetooth module, EEPROM for data storage, I2C protocol for communication, UART protocol for serial communication, and interrupts for handling password reset manually via keypad. This system provides a secure and convenient way to lock and unlock doors using a smartphone or any device with Bluetooth capability.

## Features:
- Bluetooth connectivity: Allows users to lock and unlock the system wirelessly using their smartphones.
- LCD display: Provides visual feedback and status information to the user.
- EEPROM: Stores password and other necessary data persistently.
- I2C protocol: Used for communication between microcontroller and EEPROM.
- UART protocol: Facilitates serial communication between microcontroller and other devices.
- Interrupts: Enables manual password reset functionality via keypad.

## Hardware Components:
- LPC2148 microcontroller
- LCD display
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- EEPROM
- Keypad for manual password reset
- Other necessary components (provide details if applicable)

## Software Components:
- C programming language
- Keil uVision IDE or any other compatible IDE for LPC2148 development
- Bluetooth communication libraries (if applicable)
- I2C and UART communication libraries (if applicable)
- Interrupt handling routines

## Usage:
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Set up the development environment with the necessary tools and libraries.
3. Connect the hardware components as per the provided schematic.
4. Compile and flash the code onto the LPC2148 microcontroller.
5. Power on the system and establish Bluetooth connection with the HC-05 module.
6. Follow the provided instructions for locking and unlocking the system using Bluetooth or manual keypad input.
7. Refer to the documentation for additional features and customization options.
